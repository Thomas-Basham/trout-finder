            <p>


                I created this app to help other anglers and wildlife enthusiasts connect to a valuable resource in
                Washington State. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife was kind enough to display the fish
                stocking reports in a table <a
                    href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/reports/stocking/trout-plants " target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
                It's up to all of us to help preserve these valuable resources, and I am happy to provide this free tool
                to help spread awareness of them.

                <br>
                <br>
                Rainbow trout are very adaptable. They can be stocked everywhere from high-mountain lakes and streams to
                valley reservoirs â€” and even into the fisheries in our towns and cities.
                <br>
                <br>
                The WDFW expects to stock or has stocked more than 16.2 million
                trout and kokanee into over 500 water bodies across the state to provide for excellent trout and kokanee
                fishing opportunities during 2022. The stocking is comprised of "catchables", "jumbos", "put, grow and
                take" and "fry/fingerling" plants.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Jumbo Trout</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2022, the Department will stock hundreds of lakes throughout the state with over 147,000 jumbo trout
                averaging greater than 14 inches in length and 1 pound or larger in weight.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Trout and Kokanee Fry, Fingerling and Put, Grow and Take Plants</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Over 12 million fry, fingerlings and put, grow and take fish were stocked throughout the state as
                2-to-8-inch-long fish. Kokanee fry that were stocked in 2021 will be harvestable in 2022/2023 fisheries,
                while trout fry, fingerling and put, grow and take were stocked in spring and fall 2021 for this year's
                catch.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fry, fingerlings and put, grow and take are stocked in the spring and fall, when they are able to feed
                and grow on natural food until they are large enough to be harvested. The survival rate for these
                differing sizes of fish varies depending on conditions of the lake. A number of eastern Washington lakes
                are managed so that fry survival is very good and therefore are the primary source of trout available
                for harvest. Western Washington lowland lakes depend primarily on catchable-size trout plants because of
                relatively low fry survival. In Western Washington, where fry plants are successful, the ones that
                survive supplement the catchable trout plants.
